        <h2>Popular Components of .NET</h2>
        <h3>1. ASP.NET Core</h3>
        <p>ASP.NET Core is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs. It provides a fast, reliable, and secure platform for developing modern web apps that can run on any platform. With built-in support for dependency injection, middleware, and cross-platform capabilities, ASP.NET Core is a preferred choice for web developers.</p>

        <h3>2. Xamarin</h3>
        <p>Xamarin extends the .NET platform to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android. Developers can write one codebase and share it across platforms, significantly reducing development time and effort. It also allows full access to native APIs, ensuring the apps look and feel like native mobile applications.</p>

        <h3>3. Blazor</h3>
        <p>Blazor is a framework that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. This makes it easier for developers who are already familiar with .NET technologies to create modern, client-side web apps with reusable components.</p>
